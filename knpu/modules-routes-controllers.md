# Modules Routes and Controllers

Let's do something really fun, like create a custome page. And of course
any custom code we create is going to go into a module, no different from
Drupal 7 development. 

Our modules live in modules directory of course, so let's create a new 
one there called `dino_roar`. The first thing you need to do is create the
info file, `dino_roar.info.yml`. This should remind you a lot of the former
info files in Drupal, but now it's in a yaml format. 

In here let's add name `Dino ROAR`, type `module`, description `Roar at you`
