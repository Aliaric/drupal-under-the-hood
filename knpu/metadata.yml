title:  "Drupal 8: Under the Hood"
summary: |
    **Free until Dec 25th: This tutorial will be free for a limited time to early D8
    users. Enjoy and please share!**

    Drupal 8 comes with a shuny new objecy-oriented base, and a lot of hype surrounding
    it. But personally, I *love* it. So in this screencast, I'll take you - Drupal 7
    dev - through all of the new concepts, paradigms, terms and patterns in Drupal 8.

    We'll go beyond how to *do* something and explore how things *actually work*
    in D8. What are routes? How can I use events to tap into core parts of the system?
    What's all this dependency injection and service stuff? What's this Drupal Console
    thing I keep hearing about?

    If you're serious about mastering D8, then let's go!
